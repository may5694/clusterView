./clusterView [PATH]
```

`PATH` can be a directory containing .obj files (with corresponding .mtl and textures).
It will take a moment for the meshes to load. You can rotate and zoom with the mouse.
Use the Up and Down arrow keys to switch between models for the same cluster, use the
Left and Right arrow keys to switch between different clusters.
